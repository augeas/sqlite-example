    "Regular expressions are a very powerful technique for pattern matching. They'd have to be, because otherwise no-one would put up with them. They are notoriously cryptic, and sometimes described as \"write only\". Get a regex working, then briefly look away. There's every chance you won't still be able to explain how it works. However, they can be the best solution for some information extraction tasks, so we're just going to have to practice them.\n",
